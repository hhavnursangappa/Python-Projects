# Expense Manager

This automation tool streamlines bank transaction tracking and categorization, providing a clear visual overview of expenses through a pie chart. It leverages the 'pandas' library for data analysis and 'openpyxl' for formatting and presenting the data, including the pie chart.

### 🗂️ Project Structure
- 📂 Transactions : Folder containing the transactions with the month name (case insensitive) as the file name.<br>
- 🗒️ Expense_Manager.ipynb : Jupyter notebook file containing the code to read, process, analyse the transaction data and save it in an excel file 'output.xlsx'.<br>
- 🗒️ Expense_formatter.ipynb : Jupyter notebook file containing the code to format the data in the output produced by the previous file and create a Pie-Chart for overview in another file 'formatted_output.xlsx'.

## 📚 Tech Stack
