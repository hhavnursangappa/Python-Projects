# Password Manager

This is an application where the user can store usernames and passwords for different websites and then update delete or copy them.
The user needs to remember one master key which will allow him to access the vault.

## Usage
Download / Clone the project to a folder in any desired location on your local machine. Now just run the executable *'password_manager.exe'* to boot the application. If you are opening this for the first time you will have to
create a vault using the *Create Vault* button and set a master password for that vault. If you already have a vault click on *Login*, enter the master password and you are good to go. To update, copy or delete an entry, select
the entry, right click on the data which you want to update, copy or delete and choose the required option from the menu.
